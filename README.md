# Informatics 2 - Course Exercises

This repository contains the solved exercises from the Informatics 2 course I completed at university. The course covered a range of fundamental topics in computer science, including:

- Search and sorting algorithms
- Correctness and complexity of algorithms
- Pointers and C programming
- Data structures such as lists, trees, and hashing
- Dynamic programming
- Graph theory

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different set of exercises, demonstrating my understanding and application of these concepts. This work showcases my problem-solving skills and proficiency in algorithm design and analysis.
